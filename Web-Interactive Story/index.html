                             Jad finds himself in a scary world where he knows nothing. His parents aren’t there and he is alone without money, car, house… <br>
                             He is hungry but how can he eat? <br>
                             Jad has two choices:<br>
                                1-	Steal food or money to buy food<br>
                                2-	Find a work so he earns money and buy food<br><br>
                             If he choose to work, It will be great! He should also try to earn points by helping people and doing some good things.<br>
                             If he steal anything, he will pass to the next branch<br><br>

                             Branch 2: Jail or run?<br>
                             If someone stole something, either the police will come and take him to the jail or he should run away.
                             After the stealing, Jad has two choices: <br>
                                1-	Go to the Police office: They will put him in jail then OOPS, GAME OVER!<br>
                                2-	Run away<br>
                             If he choose to run away he will pass to the next branch or he may return to the branch 1 (Stealing) <br>
                             He would do another things that're also evil. <br>
                             He may kill people in order to have money or he may take drugs so he can forget what happened with him.. Many scenarios can happen.<br><br>
                       
                            Branch 3: Kill <br>
                             If kills people he have two choices: <br>
                                1-	Go to the Police office: They will put him in jail then OOPS, GAME OVER!<br>
                                2-	Take drugs to forget what he has done: Next branch<br>
                                3-	Re-kill: return to the beginning of this branch<br>
                             If he choose to take drugs, he needs money to buy these drugs so he may return to any of the previous branches.
